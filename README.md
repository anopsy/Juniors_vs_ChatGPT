### 1. Analysis of Job Offers for Entry Level positions - Juniors and Interns
I tried to answer the question if the ChatGPT (and the rise of LLM's in general) has replaced the Juniors and Interns.

### 2. Attempt at modelling the estimated compensation using different Regression Models

Number of Job Offers from 2023 and 2024 data samples, that I obtained from [SourceStack](https://sourcestack.co/)

#### A. What I did:
1. Data cleaning
2. Data analysis
3. Baseline model
4. Comparison of different regression algorithms and their metrics

#### B. What I haven't done (yet):
1. Hyperparams tuning, I did only validation curve for the best scoring model (SVR"rbf")
2. Feature importances
3. Discussion and explanation of modelling results
